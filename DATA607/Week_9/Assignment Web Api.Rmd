## Assignment Web APIs

The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here: https://developer.nytimes.com/apis
Youâ€™ll need to start by signing up for an API key.
Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and
transform it into an R DataFrame.


```{r api}

key <-"api-key=7JkryTK6qJXaJF2SnUShiuAWlzRW0C2d"
    
url <- paste("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/topstories/v2/us.json?", key, sep="")

response <- GET(url)

#Should be 200
status_code(response)

headers(response)

results <- fromJSON(url)

df_result <- results$results

head(df_result)

#Limit my selection
df2 <- df_result %>% select(section, title, abstract, byline, contains("date"))


#Display table of top articles
df2 %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
 
```
